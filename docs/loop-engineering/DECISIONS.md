# Decisions

## 2026-07-13: Admit Before Prefill Continuation

- Decision: retain the manual scheduler and process waiting admissions after decode but before prefill.
- Reason: request timelines and existing tests showed short requests could wait behind a long prefill even when decode was idle.
- Alternative rejected: enabling `batch_generator` immediately. Its adapter is still marked unavailable and would bypass required compatibility evidence.
- Tradeoff: newly admitted prompts can preempt an existing prefill continuation, increasing fairness and short-request responsiveness while delaying the long prompt by one scheduler turn.
- Rollback: revert commit `32addf1`.
- Scope: mixed scheduling and admission latency; no claim about single-request decode kernel speed or global throughput.
