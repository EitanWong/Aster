# Decisions

## 2026-07-13: Admit Before Prefill Continuation

- Decision: retain the manual scheduler and process waiting admissions after decode but before prefill.
- Reason: request timelines and existing tests showed short requests could wait behind a long prefill even when decode was idle.
- Alternative rejected: enabling `batch_generator` immediately. Its adapter is still marked unavailable and would bypass required compatibility evidence.
- Tradeoff: newly admitted prompts can preempt an existing prefill continuation, increasing fairness and short-request responsiveness while delaying the long prompt by one scheduler turn.
- Rollback: revert commit `32addf1`.
- Scope: mixed scheduling and admission latency; no claim about single-request decode kernel speed or global throughput.

## 2026-07-13: Randomized A/B Re-evaluation

- Result: do not accept `32addf1` as a default performance profile yet.
- Evidence: seven interleaved baseline/current trials with greedy sampling gave current elapsed median `+2.86%` and completion throughput `-2.78%`; 95% bootstrap intervals included zero.
- Interpretation: the earlier grouped `-13.6%` result was affected by execution order or workload shape. The scheduler behavior may still help only when short requests arrive during an active long prefill.
- Next experiment: use a staggered arrival workload that submits the long prompt first and short requests after prefill has begun.
